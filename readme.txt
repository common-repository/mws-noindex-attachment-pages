== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I check the plugin is working? =
Go to your attachment page, right click and view the source in your browser and search for "noindex" you should find it in head of the page. If you see it, then it's working! If you cannot find it in the source, then it is not working. This may be due to some other plugin mostly SEO which is overriding meta tags of the page. Feel free to contact us if it is not working for you. 
= How do I view my attachment page?=
In any old post, add an image and make sure to select “Attachment Page” in the link to drop down. Update or publish your post and visit it in the front end. By clicking the image in the post you’ll be taken to an attachment page. It may not look good (depending on your theme) but it is an attachment page.
